####The object-fit property can have the following values:

* **fill** - This is default. The replaced content is sized to fill the element's content box. If necessary, the object will be stretched or squished to fit
* **contain** - The replaced content is scaled to maintain its aspect ratio while fitting within the element's content box
* **cover** - The replaced content is sized to maintain its aspect ratio while filling the element's entire content box. The object will be clipped to fit
* **none** - The replaced content is not resized
* **scale-down** - The content is sized as if none or contain were specified (would result in a smaller concrete object size)
